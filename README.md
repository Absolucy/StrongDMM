StrongDMM is an alternative yet robust map editor for BYOND. 

It was built with idea to create a more flexible, fast and extensible tool, than BYOND built-in map editor. The editor has same features DM has, but provides much more and improves general map editing experience.

## Features

The editor provides a bunch of new features:
 * TGM support with built in map merger (no need to use external scripts and pre-commit hooks);
 * Almost instant environment open;
 * Custom layers filter;
 * Built-in screenshot tool;
 * Smooth zoom-in/zoom-out;
 * Robust "Search&Replace";
 * Improved shortcuts;
 * Robust variables editor and variables preview;
 * Optional variables sanitizing;

...and a lot more...
