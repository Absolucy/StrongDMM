# Strong Dream Map Maker
Yet another robust map editor for BYOND.

### What is it
StrongDMM is an alternative map editor for BYOND. It was built with thoughts to create a more flexible, fast and extensible tool,
than the native one.

The editor provides a bunch of new features:
 * TGM support with built in map merger (no need to use external scripts and pre-commit hooks)
 * Almost instant environment open
 * Smooth zoom-in/zoom-out
 * Robust "search&replace"
 * Improved shortcuts
 * Variables preview for the active object
 * Robust variables editor
 * Optional variables sanitizing

...and a lot of more...

### How to Use
The recommended way is to use `sdmmlauncher`. Launcher will ensure that you are using the up to date version of the editor.

**Download links:**
* [Windows](https://github.com/SpaiR/StrongDMM/releases/latest/download/sdmmlauncher.exe)
* [Linux](https://github.com/SpaiR/StrongDMM/releases/latest/download/sdmmlauncher)

You are also able to download the editor manually. Go to the [release](https://github.com/SpaiR/StrongDMM/releases/latest)
page and download zip for your OS.
